# Arduino Data Logging
Advanced Topics in Web Programming 1501

### Overview
Using Xively, data.sparkfun.com or another similar service, you will need to collect 24 hours worth of environmental data using an Arduino and the Ethernet Shield. You will then create a web interface for displaying that data to users.

Using an ethernet shield, photoresistor, and a temperature sensor the Arduino was wired to record both temperature and light in its surroundings. The Arduino was hooked up for slightly over 24 hours recording data every 30 seconds. This data was stored on [data.sparkfun.com](https://data.sparkfun.com/streams/bGbzn6QJJgTmWYz1r82d) and accessed via json.
